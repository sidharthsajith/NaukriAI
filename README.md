pip install -r requirements.txt
export GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Usage

#### CV Analyzer
```bash
# Basic usage
python cv_analyser.py path/to/resume.pdf

# Save output to a file
python cv_analyser.py path/to/resume.pdf --output analysis.json

# Specify Groq API key (optional if set in environment)
python cv_analyser.py path/to/resume.pdf --api-key your_api_key_here
```

#### Advanced Features
To launch the complete application with all features:
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

##### PeopleGPT Search Engine
```bash
python groq_search.py
```

Natural language search examples:
- "Find senior developers with experience in Python"
- "Candidates with 5+ years experience in AI/ML"
- "Junior developers with skills in React or Angular"

##### Advanced Candidate Matching
Use the Streamlit interface to:
1. Upload job requirements or enter them manually
2. Set skill weights (required vs preferred)
3. Filter candidates by seniority, location, and employment type
4. View detailed matching reports and AI-generated interview questions

For programmatic use:
```python
from advanced_matching import AdvancedCandidateMatcher

matcher = AdvancedCandidateMatcher('dataset.json')
matches = matcher.match_candidates(
    required_skills=['Python', 'Machine Learning'],
    preferred_skills=['TensorFlow', 'PyTorch'],
    seniority='Senior',
    top_n=5
)
```

## Future Development Roadmap
